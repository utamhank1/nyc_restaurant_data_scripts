For each entry in AllData, crosssearch address (column c) with the addresses stored in UniqueAddressess

If there is a match (there will be except for a few cases where addressess were not in manhattan), examine the SearchQuery element in AllData. There are 12 different ones.

Update the columns in UniqueAddressess corresponding to the SearchQuery. The desired metrics are below:

1 number of restaurants (coumn B in AllData)
2 average rating (not sure the best way to calculate average iteratively; perhaps store the number of entries included in the average and iterate by 1 each time its updated)
3 average rating2 (not all of them will have a rating2 or numrating2)
4 average numrating
5 average numrating2
6 average Rating Difference

Using similar code to calculate population in each radius, calculate the average of all of the new columns we have for each address
